        <p>
          Full-stack developer with a master and bachelor degree in electrical
          and computer engineering (ECE). I have a solid understanding of
          mathematics and good logic thinking. My passion for learning things
          under the hood and solving complex problems makes me interested in
          solving problems with clean and efficient codes. The speed at which I
          learn gives me the opportunity to continually learn new skills and the
          latest technologies.
